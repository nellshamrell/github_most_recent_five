# github_most_recent_five

This is a proof of concept repo.

I wanted to be able to query the Github API with a username, then receive back the user's top five "Repositories contributed to" (like you see when you look at a [user's profile on Github](https://github.com/nellshamrell).

Unfortunately, there does not currently appear to be a good way to do this [through the API](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20714593/github-api-repositories-contributed-to), at least not without having to do way too many requests per user.

This code, instead, will return the top five most recently updated repositories for a given user.  It's not exactly what I was looking for, but it's good enough for now to get an idea of a user's contributions on Github.

This is still a work on progress, but I will update with details on how to use it once I get those completed.
